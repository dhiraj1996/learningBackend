//What is express
//Express JS is a small framework that works on top of Node web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your applicationâ€™s functionality with middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.

//Express gives very good structure to the code.
//Also it have all http functionality which removes lots of clutter to the code
